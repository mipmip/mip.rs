# Markdown Instant Preview - Rust edition

![](mip.png)

Markdown Instant Preview aka `mip` is a fast and bloatless markdown document
viewer. Mip uses a webview window to render the markdown. I wrote `mip` to
preview my markdown files which I write in vim.

After a first attempt of developing [Mip in
Crystal](https://github.com/mipmip/mip.cr), Rust seemed a better choice as it
has more mature parallism support. This is essential for running webview next
to a webserver.

See the simple workflow in this video...

## Features

- built-in webserver
- preview images

- autoreload if file changes
- uft8 & ðŸ¤” support

## Installation

The latest Mip binaries for Mac and Windows can be downloaded [at the release
pages](https://github.com/mipmip/mip.rs/releases/latest). Currently we have
[problems building Linux binaries](https://github.com/mipmip/mip.rs/issues/4)
with our workflow. Help with this would be appreciated.

## Usage

```
mip [markdown file]
```
